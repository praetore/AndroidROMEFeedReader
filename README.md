AndroidROMEFeedReader
=====================

Android ROME FeedReader example that supports Android 3.0+

It's almost the same as on the [original Google Code repository](https://code.google.com/p/android-rome-feed-reader/), except that one isn't supported for 
Android 3.0 and higher. Since Android 3.0, you [cannot perform network operations on the main thread](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/NetworkOnMainThreadException.html).
